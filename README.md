# Essay Quality Ranker

A tool that analyzes Markdown files, assigns each file an "editing effort" score, and displays a ranked list in the terminal from highest (worst draft) to lowest (best draft).

## What It Does

This tool helps you prioritize your editing efforts by evaluating essays/documents based on three metrics:

1. **LLM Edit-Effort Score (0-100)**: Uses GPT models to evaluate how much revision is needed
2. **Grammar Error Rate (0-100)**: Counts grammar errors per 1,000 words
3. **Readability Gap (0-100)**: Measures how far above 8th grade reading level the text is

A composite score is calculated with customizable weights (default: 60% LLM, 20% grammar, 20% readability).

## Installation

```bash
pip install openai textstat language_tool_python python-dotenv tqdm rich
```

You'll need an OpenAI API key. Set it as an environment variable or place it in a `.env` file next to the script:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key
```

## Usage

Basic usage:

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 essay-quality-ranker.py sample
```

Where `sample` is the directory containing your Markdown files.

### Optional Arguments

- `--weights`: Customize the scoring weights (default: 0.6 0.2 0.2)
- `--model`: Specify the OpenAI model to use (default: gpt-4o-mini)
- `--output` or `-o`: Save results to a CSV file

Examples:

```bash
# Custom weights (90% LLM, 5% grammar, 5% readability)
/usr/bin/python3 essay-quality-ranker.py sample --weights 0.9 0.05 0.05

# Use a different model
/usr/bin/python3 essay-quality-ranker.py sample --model gpt-4

# Save to CSV
/usr/bin/python3 essay-quality-ranker.py sample --output results.csv
```

## Output

The script displays a color-coded table directly in your terminal:
- ðŸ”´ Red rows: High scores (70+) - essays that need significant work
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow rows: Medium scores (40-69) - essays that need moderate editing
- ðŸŸ¢ Green rows: Low scores (<40) - essays that are in good shape

## Caching

Results are cached in a `.cache_edit_scores` folder within your target directory, so you only pay for LLM API calls once per file.
